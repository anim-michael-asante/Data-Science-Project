## About
This repository contains projects where I apply machine learning and data science techniques to real-world datasets. Projects include exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and visualization of data insights.  

Each project demonstrates my ability to clean data, engineer features, build models, and evaluate performance using standard metrics.

## Project Highlights
- **Project 1** – Predictive modeling using [dataset name], including data cleaning, feature selection, and machine learning algorithms.
- **Project 2** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Project 3** – Implementation of classification and regression models using Scikit-Learn and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and RMSE.
- More projects coming soon…

## Technologies
- **Languages:** Python, R (if applicable)
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow / PyTorch (if applicable)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
